# game-rock-paper-scissors

This code creates an HTML page with three buttons for the user to choose between "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors".
Clicking on one of the buttons calls the play() function in JavaScript. 
The function generates a random choice for the computer and compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the outcome of the game. 
The result is displayed on the page within the element with the id "result".
